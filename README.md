# Fine-Tuning SAM 2 for Surgical Scene Segmentation

## Overview
This repository contains the code for fine-tuning and evaluating the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) to enhance its semantic segmentation performance on anatomical tissues/organs in surgical videos/images. The fine-tuned model, **SurgiSAM 2**, demonstrates remarkable accuracy in segmenting organs and tissues, even with limited training data of 50 samples per class.

## Datasets
The following surgical video/image datasets were used:

1. **CholecSeg8k** [1]: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy images.
2. **Dresden** [2]: Colorectal surgery images.
3. **UreterUD** [3]: Urological surgery images.
4. **Endoscapes** [4]: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy images.
5. **m2caiSeg** [5]: Minimally invasive abdominal surgery images.

## Results
- **Zero-shot weighted mean Dice coefficient (WMDC)**: 
  - 0.84 (**Hiera Large**) 
  - 0.78 (**Hiera Base Plus**).
- **Fine tuning** the image encoder and mask decoder (of Base Plus model) improved WMDC to **0.92** (+0.14 - relative increase of 17.9% over baseline).
- **Impact of training data scale** on finetuned model performance:
  - **0.9288** (with 400 samples per class, 10-point prompts).
  - **0.912** (with 50 samples per class, 10-point prompts).
- **Outperformed SOTA** on 24/30 (80%) of all organ classes.
- **Generalization**: Outperformed SOTA on 7/9 (**77.8%**) of unseen organ classes.
